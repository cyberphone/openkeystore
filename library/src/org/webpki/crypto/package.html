<h3>Crypto - Cryptographic Algorithms and Utilities</h3>
The Crypto library adds a thin layer on top of JCA making it easy dealing
with IETF's JOSE and COSE as well as with WebPKI's SKS algorithm schemes.
<p>In addition, there are utility classes for handling the more common
parts of X.509 certificates such as key usage bits on a high(er) level.</p>
<p>To aid certificate selection both in UIs and in protocols like KeyGen2,
there is a certificate filter class.</p>
